Heat 1 tbsp olive oil, Salute bell peepers or onions on a high flamejust for two minutes,You can also skip bell peppers and use onions, the taste would be different but good, Set them aside cool.

To the same pan add ripe tomatoes and salute for two - three minutes.

Tomatoes must turn soft, Add red chilli flaakes as needed, Set this aside to cool.

When cooled, add them to a blender jar.

Blend to a smooth or coarse paste, I prefer smooth, Set this aside.

While you make the sauce, you can bring two litres bottle to bil in a large pot, add salt as needed.

When the water comes to a boil, add pasta, Cook al dente following the instruction on the pack.

Drain off in a colander and rinse to remove extra starch.

Put back the same pan on the stove with another one tbsp oil, When hot saute garlic and red chilli flakes until they turn fragrant.

Add chopped onions.

Saute unntil the raw smell goes away.

Add puree and salt, Mix and cook on medium heat until the sauce thickens.

This is the consistency i prefer, you cn even take off a little earlier, Addoregano, Mix well, Off the stove.

Add the cooked pasta, I prefer another tbsp oil now, This is optional.

Saute until well combined.

Add crushed pepper, Serve pasta in red sauce hot.
